1,Question 2,2,4,3,2,4,4,1,Too short,5,5,'it worth a try' and 'this should be used','I don't fully unerstand the question/problem text',"Not a bug but I dont really understand the benifit of the countdown, it was very distracting "
2,Question 2,4,3,1,1,1,4,3,Too short,5,5,"Feeling good, Feeling bad","The annotations should correspond to a certain piece of code, so I should be able to select one or more lines for which the annotation applies. There should also be a custom annotation. ",
3,Question 2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,Too short,4,4,I don't understand most of these annotations. They don't make sense to me. They don't seem to use idiomatic English.,"""I'm stuck"", ""This is easy"", ""This is hard"", ""I need help"", ""I can do this"", ""This is more difficult than I thought"".",
4,Question 1,2,3,3,3,3,4,2,About right,2,2,Looking up/into it,Other should probably be the last option,
5,Question 1,2,4,3,2,3,4,5,About right,4,3,This should be used,I have to Google it,
6,Question 2,2,4,4,2,3,2,3,About right,2,2,Testing it,Maybe some annotation around where in the code a programmer may be stuck. That way the annotation can be a bookmark for the programmer to pick up on coding at a later time.,n/a
7,Question 2,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,About right,3,3,this should be used,nothing in particular. ,
8,Question 2,2,3,2,2,4,3,3,Too short,3,3,i am not clear on the context of when they should be used.. only when the timer runs out?,"this should have worked, naive approach first, need to optimize",the code didnt appear to compile and run when i returned an int
9,Question 2,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,About right,5,5,I don't think I'd be likely to use any of them.  I prefer custom annotations.,I think they are all dependent on exactly what is being programmed.,
10,Question 1,4,1,2,2,2,2,1,Too short,5,5,I'm not entirely clear on the purpose of the annotation options.,Not sure,"Clicking the annotation buttons displayed a toast message, but didn't change anything in the coding window? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be added as a comment?"
11,Question 2,4,4,4,3,4,2,2,About right,2,2,all make sense to me,n/a,n/a
12,Question 2,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,About right,2,2,This Must be correct,What is the syntax? - When I forgot the syntax of for loop.,
13,Question 1,2,2,2,2,3,4,3,About right,4,4,"""This should be used""","""Stuck on this/debugging""","the code editor needs to be more like a real IDE, instead of just whitespace with no line counter or syntax highlighting."
14,Question 1,4,5,3,2,2,1,4,About right,3,2,NA,NA,
15,Question 2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,About right,3,3,na,na,
17,Question 1,3,4,4,3,4,2,1,About right,2,2,It worth a try,Trying to remember the correct syntax;  Does python require type definiton for function variable declaration? Why can't I remember this?,no bugs encountered
18,Question 2,3,2,3,2,3,4,4,Too short,4,4,it worth a try,ask a friend?,
20,Question 1,1,1,1,1,1,5,3,Too short,4,2,This must be correct,Thinking...,
21,Question 1,3,4,4,3,3,4,3,Too short,4,4,"""Feeling bad"" might not be most constructive annotation.","Maybe more customizable options. Like ""Refer class XX function XX""",I didn't encounter any problems
22,Question 1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,Too short,4,5,Its worth a try,"""Googling this"" when Im stuck",
23,Question 1,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,Too short,3,3,None,None,
24,Question 2,2,4,2,1,1,4,1,Too short,5,5,"The feeling good/bad annotations seem particularly unnecessary to me, since I'm unlikely to leave comments about my feelings in code.","It's hard to replicate the thought process and 'flow' state of programming a novel problem on such a small sample task, but an annotation for a ""hack"", or something inefficient that should be changed later, would be helpful.",
25,Question 1,4,5,4,2,4,2,1,About right,3,3,"1/2 and 6/7 seem redundant to me, I had no use for them in my test","""no idea"" may work well for if you have a comment explaining a line of code that you have no idea how to write yet",
26,Question 1,4,2,2,2,4,3,1,Too short,2,2,"I think some of these annotation buttons are still placeholders. This should be used, it worth a try did not make sense to me.","I think sentiment buttons should be sentiment icons, and the annotation buttons should just be various reflective thoughts that one could have such as: Still working, running through a test case etc.",
